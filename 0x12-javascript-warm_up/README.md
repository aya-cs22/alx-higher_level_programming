My First JavaScript Code
Welcome to my journey in JavaScript coding! This repository contains my initial steps in learning JavaScript programming. You'll find my first lines of code as I dive into the world of web development.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions. Remember, every journey begins with a single step, and I'm excited to embark on this coding adventure!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
